TestCase 1: Test the method to calculate the total price for a given number of tickets and their prices to ensure accurate calculation
Description: This test ensures the OTTS payment calculations are working as intended. Ensure the OTTS ticket page displays the correct data and is responsive. The ticket page should correctly display the ticket type (e.g., Adult, Senior), number of tickets, order total, seats selected, correctly calculated order total, discounted tickets (if applicable), and only allow users to purchase a maximum of 20 tickets before the user proceeds. In addition, this test should ensure that the ‘Ticket’ class works as intended and properly stores and accepts data.
Test Sets/Vectors: In order to thoroughly check the integrity of the ticket page, the tester should select a movie from the home page, select seat(s), select number of tickets and their type, and manually calculate all costs to ensure that the calculations are correct. This test must be done across all platforms to ensure that each platform (e.g. mobile, desktop, laptop, etc.) works properly and shows the correct price as well as other ticket information.
How does it cover the targeted features?: The test covers several of the targeted features of the online theater ticketing system. It ensures correct numerical calculations for the tickets selected by the user; it displays the selected number of tickets, the ticket type, and the ticket price. It also covers the unit test requirement by testing a small piece of code to ensure code quality and its integral part of the software.

TestCase 2:  Ensure that users can select seats from an interactive seating chart and add them to their cart.
Description: This test ensures that the OTTS seat selection page is working as intended. This test should ensure the responsiveness of user interaction with the seat page. When a user selects a seat, the seat should be highlighted. When the user clicks “Confirm Seat(s),” the selected seats should be invisible to other users to simulate that they have been purchased and taken. The seat and theater number should be displayed at the top of the screen. The user should only be able to select a maximum of 20 seats per transaction. The Seat Class should be working as intended. Data about the seat should be properly displayed, such as seat_number and theater number.
Test Sets/Vectors: In order to thoroughly check the integrity of the seat selection page, the tester should simulate a real interaction with the OTTS and choose a seat as you would if you were trying to purchase tickets online. The tester should select a movie from the home page. The tester should select a seat. Once the seats are selected, the tester should verify that the seat page properly displays the correct information about their seat (Ex. Seat number and theater number). In addition, the user should only be able to select a maximum of 20 seats per transaction. Once the seats are selected, the tester should then confirm that the ‘Confirm Seat(s)” button is working as intended and make sure selected seats are not showing for other users. This test must be done across all platforms to ensure that each platform (e.g. mobile, desktop, laptop, etc.) works properly and shows the correct price and other ticket information. If all is working as intended and the data matches, the test has passed. 
How does it cover the targeted features?: The test covers multiple targeted features of the OTTS that are integral to the site. It ensures that the ticket selection process presents all of the data that the customer would need when trying to see a movie. As the customer is accessing the seat selection page, selected seats should be highlighted, and the seat number and theater number should be displayed; a maximum of 20 seats should be able to be selected at a time, and the “Confirm Seat(s)” button should work as intended and make selected seats invisible to other users.  This test covers the functional requirement because the amount of selected seats is 20 maximum, and the seat selection page works properly.

TestCase 3: Simulate heavy concurrent traffic on the website to assess system stability and performance under load.
Description: This test ensures that the OTTS is able to have a minimum of 2000 concurrent users. The OTTS should be able to handle a minimum of 2000 concurrent users without reductions in speed and latency. All functions should be operational on the site while it is being used. 
Test Sets/Vectors: To thoroughly test the OTTS capacity and function under load, the testing team should automate 2000 user accounts to use functions on the website just as regular users would. With this, the testing team will be able to check if the OTTS can handle such, and make sure the performance is optimal. Testers should monitor latency, responsiveness, and stability to make sure that the test is as thorough as possible. If the OTTS is functional, responsive, stable, and has zero to minimal change in latency, the test is passed.
How does it cover the targeted features?: The test covers multiple targeted features of the OTTS that are the most important to the site. This test ensured that the OTTS would be able to handle a minimum of 2000 concurrent users without reductions in speed, functions, and latency. These actions can include but are not limited to, browsing current movies, seat selection, ticket selection, and payment tests all at the same time. This test covers the system test requirement because it confirms that the OTTS can handle a surge of users while staying responsive and fast.
